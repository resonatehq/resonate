## Why Resonate?

Resonate offers a programming model that allows you to build distributed applications using an intuitive paradigm you already know — async await.

## What is Distributed Async Await?

Distributed Async Await extends the async await programming model beyond the boundaries of a single process and makes distributed computing a first-class citizen.

## Install

Resonate is currently in active development without a formal release cycle. We welcome early adopters to experiment with the latest build from main as we work towards our first stable release. Your [feedback](https://github.com/resonatehq/resonate/issues/new/choose) is greatly appreciated.

## Getting Started

Resonate makes it easy to get started creating and interacting with durable promises. Follow these steps to build and run Resonate, then start creating and completing promises.

1. **Build and Run**

   The resonate server supports `http` and `grpc` protocols as well as `sqlite` and `postgres` as a data store.

   ```console
   # Build
   go build -o resonate

   # Start
   ./resonate serve
   ```

   Once running, you'll see log output like:

   ```console
   time=2023-01-01T00:00:00.000-00:00 level=INFO msg="starting http server" addr=0.0.0.0:8001
   time=2023-01-01T00:00:00.000-00:00 level=INFO msg="starting grpc server" addr=0.0.0.0:50051
   time=2023-01-01T00:00:00.000-00:00 level=INFO msg="starting metrics server" addr=:9090
   ```

2. **Create a Promise**

   On a separate terminal, create a durable promise.

   ```console
   # Create a promise with data, headers and tags
   resonate promises create foo --timeout 1h --data foo --header bar=bar --tag baz=baz
   ```

3. **Complete a Promise**

   Finally, complete the promise by resolving or rejecting.

   ```console
   # Resolve a promise with data and headers 
   resonate promises resolve foo --data foo --header bar=bar
   ```

   ```console
   # Reject a promise with data and headers
   resonate promises reject foo --data foo --header bar=bar
   ```

## Write Distributed Async Await Applications   

Resonate provides client SDKs for different programming languages to easily interact with the Resonate server and write elegant distributed async await applications. More are coming soon!
